# GeoSpatialRelations.jl

## What is GeoSpatialRelations.jl?
GeoSpatialRelations.jl is a freely usable library for the Julia programming language designed to manage geometric relationships in three-dimensional space. This library provides essential functionalities for working with various geometric objects such as circles, spheres, straight lines, and planes. It enables users to compute fundamental geometric relationships between these objects, including intersections and the smallest distance.

## Current Features
- Intersections: Calculate intersections between geometric objects.
- Smallest Distance: Find the smallest distance between objects in space.
- More features can be easily added and extended.

## How can I use FMI.jl?
To use GeoSpatialRelations.jl, simply clone the repository or install it using Julia's package manager:

1\. Open a Julia-REPL, switch to package mode using `]`, activate your preferred environment.

2\. Install [*GeoSpatialRelations.jl*](https://github.com/adribrune/GeoSpatialRelations.jl.git):
```julia-repl
(@v1) pkg> add GeoSpatialRelations
```

## What is GeoSpatialRelations.jl?
[*GeoSpatialRelations.jl*](https://github.com/ThummeTo/FMI.jl) is a freely usable library for the Julia programming language designed to handle geometric relationships in space. This library provides essential functionalities for working with various geometric objects such as circles, spheres, straight lines, and planes. It allows users to determine fundamental relationships between these objects, including intersections and the smallest distance.

## Features
- Intersections: Calculate intersections between geometric objects.
- Smallest Distance: Find the smallest distance between objects in space.
- More features can be easily added and extended.


## How can I use FMI.jl?
